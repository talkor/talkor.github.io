Hi there! I'm Talko, a passionate Software Developer with a flair for creating sleek and user-friendly interfaces. I've spent a significant part of my career energizing digital platforms and tools, using my go-to tech superheroes - JavaScript, Vue.js, React and Node.js.

Away from the screen, I can be found playing melodious tunes on my guitar and MIDI keyboard, freezing moments with my camera, geeking out over space launches, or diving headfirst into a fascinating new language. I might be a tech enthusiast through and through, but I've got a wild side reserved for creativity too :)
